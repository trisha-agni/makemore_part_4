In this file I manually backpropagate through each variable in a neural network rather than using loss.backward(). This was an opportunity for me to apply the calculus skills I learned in my AP Calculus classes to a real world problem.

What I learned:

Math:
- Calculating derivatives involving matrices

AI:
- Bessel's correction: adjustment to sample variance formula
  - used when sample size is smaller
